What is AI?
	//systems that perform tasks that normally require human intelligence [this definition can include both classical AI and ML]
	
Forms of AI:
	- classical AI 
	- Machine Learning [learns patterns that lie within data]
[nowadays, "AI" usually refers to ML type of AI]


		
small talk about classical AI:
	- it's old, solved an entirely different set of problems
	- rule based and deterministic 
	- some use cases:
		* path finding in video games [when an enemy character chases you]
		* finding optimal strategy [playing chess or tic-tac-toe against a computer]
		  [some visual examples on these would be great]
		Show that AI existed before data-hungry neural networks.


Machine Learning:
	- what is ML?
	- Loss functions


ML types of learning:
	- supervised learning [most type form of learning]
	- unsupervised learning
	- Reinforcement Learning 
	- semi-supervised [out of scope / complicated]

Supervised Learning:
	- Definition ...
	- Regression [predicting a continuous variable]
		* examples
	- Classification [predicting a discrete variable]
		* examples


Unsupervised Learning
	- Definition
	- examples [Image Generation and clustering]
	
	
- Reinforcement Learning
	- Definition
	- often conducted in virtual environments
	- Examples [self driving cars .... and more]/applications
	
	
main fields of AI:
	- Computer Vision
		* examples: detection, segmentation, classification, style transfer, reconstruction, ...
		* applications
	- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
		* Text, speech, translation, modern chatbots [GPT, Gemini, ...]
		* applications
	- Speech & Audio Processing
		* Voice assistants
		* Speech-to-text
		* applications
	- Robotics
		* Perception + control + RL
		* applications
	- Recommendation Systems [the things that keep you doomscrolling]
		* YouTube, Netflix, Amazon
	
	- there are applications where more than one field are involved [image generation through text]
		* AI Clone [more on that later]
		* Engineering applications
		
modern AI wouldn't have existed without these 3 pillars
	Better data + better models[better representation (Neural networks | Deep Learning)] + better hardware = AI boom

Deep Learning: 
	- definition [more specific form of ML]
	- utilizes Neural Networks

		
Neural Networks [the engine behind modern AI]: 
	- definition
	- some visuals
	- tunable parameters
	- starts with random parameters/weights, get adjusted to minimize a loss function 
	- maybe a simple visual example of a simple binary classifier that starts off random and then perfectly makes a decision boundary
	- CNNs way of operating and learning

Common forms of Neural Networks:
	- simple neural network [interconnected weights]
	- simple CNN [VGG sort of CNN]
	- CNN with skip connections [layer takes input, does magic, gives an output, input is added to the output and both are passed to the next layer]
		- modern Chatbots make use of the previous 2 techniques
	- Siamese Netowkrs
	- Generator Discriminator / Actor Critic
	- UNets
	- Encoder Decoder
	- RNNs
	- Transformers 


AI Clone:
